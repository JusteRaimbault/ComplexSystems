Root repository for all research
 (complexity / complex systems always present?)

Organisation of submodules: TBD

 -> by themes, with additional utils, rather than Knowledge Domains: org with KDs within each project
 -> index/browsing/ knowledge graph explo that can change viewpoint/projection: by theme, by KD, by discipline etc?

[priv/public: specify in repo list]
